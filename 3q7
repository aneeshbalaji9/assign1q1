Create a new column that is the ratio of Self-Citations to Total Citations. What is the maximum value for this new column, and what country has the highest ratio?

This function should return a tuple with the name of the country and the ratio.

def answer_seven():
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    Top15 = answer_one()
    Top15["Ratio"] = Top15["Self-citations"] / Top15["Citations"]
    return Top15["Ratio"].argmax(), Top15["Ratio"].max()
answer_seven()
    raise NotImplementedError()

The dataset file in assets/grades.txt contains a line separated list of people with their grade in a class. Create a regex to generate a list of just those students who received a B in the course.

import re
def grades():
    with open ("assets/grades.txt", "r") as file:
        grades = file.read()
â€‹
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    #raise NotImplementedError()
    pattern = "[\w]*\[\w]*(?=:\ B)"
    return re.findall(pattern,grades)
